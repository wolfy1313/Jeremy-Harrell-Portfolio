# My Portfolio Site

This site was generated using @austin-rt's [`create-react-skeleton`](https://github.com/austin-rt/create-react-skeleton) project, and it's hosted [here](https://jeremyharrell.net/).

## Development

In the project directory, you can still run:

### `npm install react-scripts && npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Still builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
